            <p>Hi, I’m Berkay Naldöken, and I’m studying Geomatic Engineering at Hacettepe University. I’ve been here since 2018, and I’ve always been interested in how technology helps us understand and shape the world.

                I’ve done internships with the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure in Ankara and Mutlular Harita, where I worked on things like mapping and spatial data. It was a really good experience because I got to use what I learned in real projects.
                
                I’m comfortable with tools like Python, ArcGIS, and QGIS, and I’ve also learned a bit of web development with HTML and CSS, which gives me more flexibility.
                
                When I’m not studying, I like to stay active. I enjoy playing volleyball, swimming, and fishing. I also love watching movies and keeping up with tech trends—there’s always something new to check out.
                
                I’m fluent in Turkish, and my English is pretty good. As I move forward, I’m excited about how I can use what I’ve learned to contribute to the field of geomatics.<div>
